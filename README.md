# Poolside
### A Hold 'em and Knowledge Pool Inspired Multiplayer Magic: The Gathering Format

Poolside is a new and developing Magic: The Gathering format designed by Conor Collins, aiming to draw on the dynamism of multiplayer Commander and the endless strategy of Hold 'em poker, with a cheek-kiss of chaos. With the popularity of Commander and the long history of 60-card decks, Poolside is a nod to what makes both formats engaging.

*Note: I am not a judge, nor do I have that level of knowledge of the rules, so I am bound to have some priority/layering and other rules details to reconcile.*

## Format Overview
Poolside is a multiplayer format that revolves around a shared card zone, known as the Pool. This zone acts as a collective resource for all players, dynamically evolving as the game progresses, making gameplay and deck construction unpredictable.

## Deck Construction
- **Deck Size**: Minimum of 80 cards.
- **Card Limit**: Up to two copies of any non-basic land card; no limit on basic lands.
- **Color Identity**: No restrictions.
- **Sets and Frames**: All MTG sets and frames are allowed.

## Starting Conditions
- **Life Total**: 30 for 4-player games; 20 for 2-player games. (This might change to 20 for 4-player games.)
- **Initial Setup**: Each player exiles the top three cards of their library to form the communal Pool and then draws three cards for their starting hand.

## Gameplay Mechanics and Design
- **The Pool**: Players can cast spells from the Pool just like they could from their hand.
- **Pool Refill**: When the Pool drops below three cards per player, it is refilled from each player's library on the card's exit from the Pool and before the cast/play/put/choose trigger.
- **Hand Size**: Standard hand size is 7, with a starting hand of 3. This is to keep interaction with the Pool at a maximum but not give an advantage to reanimate decks that would benefit.
- **Mulligans**: Unique sequence (3,3,2,1) to balance hand and pool.

## Special Rules
- **Interaction with Exile**: This is an open question still,  can cards in the pool be interacted with as if they are in exile?
- **Library and Graveyard Interaction**: Standard MTG rules apply for empty libraries. i.e., cards can be in your Pool, but you can still lose from drawing a card from an empty library.
- **Stack Interaction**: Standard rules for stack interaction are followed.

## Banned Cards
An evolving ban list is maintained, starting with the Power Nine. The list will be updated based on playtesting feedback.

## Custom Mechanics and Zones
- **"Pool"**: Is a zone where three cards are maintained as long as a player is in the game.
- **"Fill"**: Adds cards from the library to the Pool.
- **"Empty"**: Removes cards from the Pool.

## Strategic Considerations
Players must balance their strategy between the Pool and personal resources, adapting to the dynamic gameplay environment.  For instance Cards Like Homeward Path are massively transformative to teh board state and will shuffle lands, creatures and all other permanents around.

## Playtesting and Feedback
Your feedback is crucial... When I am ready to receive it.  Currently i am setting up this site and playtesting locally to kick it all off. Please share your experiences and suggestions to refine and improve the Poolside format when I have those areas of this site flushed out.
